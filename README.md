# party-hat-generator
Party hat generator for 3D-printing

Print using vase - or spiral mode for best results. See printed hints when exporting.


## Installation
Tested with Python 3.9.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install python dependencies using `pip -r requirements.txt`

The last step will install a specific cadquery version, as this project is dependent on 3mf export format support. You could need to upgrade your slicer to use the produced files.
